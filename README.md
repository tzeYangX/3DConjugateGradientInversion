# 3DConjugateGradientInversion
Pre-condition Conjugate Gradient code for Tensor Gradient Field's 3D Inversion with Sparsity Constrain

These code represent my work of Mater Thesis.

Using pre-condition conjugate gradient, we can reconstruct the 3D tensor gradient field.

In this repository you can find:

1)the modeling of tensor gradient field(magnetic field particularly in this one)

2)the conjugate gradient descent with pre-condition

3)the sparsity constraint & weighted constraint in optimization
